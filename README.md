# CustomerSegmentation
Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)** for clustering a dataset. DBSCAN is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points based on density and can identify clusters of arbitrary shape while marking outliers as noise.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains customer-related features (e.g., spending habits, income).
- Preprocessing steps include:
  - Handling missing values
  - Scaling data for better clustering performance

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas)
- **Scikit-learn** (KMeans, DBSCAN, StandardScaler)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
3. **Applying KMeans & DBSCAN Algorithm**  
4. **Visualizing Clusters**  
5. **Analyzing Results and Insights**  

---

## 📈 Results
- KMeans created clear customer segments.
- DBSCAN identified clusters and **outliers**, making it useful for detecting irregular spending behaviors.
